# Reflection

**Which AI tool(s) did you use?**  
I used ChatGPT to help generate parts of the HTML and CSS.

**How did it help you?**  
It provided a clean structure for the contact form, responsive layout, and styled color palette quickly.

**What challenges did you encounter?**  
Getting the contact form to look professional and mobile responsive required tweaks. Understanding how to connect GitHub Pages with the files also took some trial and error.

**What did you learn overall about using AI for coding?**  
AI speeds up repetitive tasks and helps structure layouts, but I still had to review and adjust code for my brandâ€™s style and functionality. It works best as a collaborator, not a full replacement.
